COMPO is a graphical design utility for creating compositions
in one or more specified areas of a printed page, or for creating
PNG or SVG images of arbitrary size.

2014/01/29 Checked in changes that allow clean build with warnings
and deprecations on.

Regularized shape and geometric objects so they are all implemented
in a similar way for eae of maintenance.

Added a more complete implementation of flatten and drawing, and a new
pattern type - BrushDabs. This introduces the idea of 'shim' layers/
objects that do not normally display themselves, but effect the
following layer. So BrushDabs will be used as fill for any closed shape
or geometric object that is placed over it.
